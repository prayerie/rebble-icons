Vector art of each Pebble model, used in the Fossil app. Layers are separated so that each layer can be colored individually to represent different models of watch, and they are arranged from top to bottom in order: Screen stroke, Screen fill, Body stroke, Body fill, Buttons stroke (Pebble 2 only).
